The sunlight struggled to pierce through the moisture, creating a warm yet slightly dreamy atmosphere. A winding stream flowed through the village, and a bridge lay across it, like a link between two worlds.\nLi Xiaomo was a renowned painter in the village. His works always carried an indescribable vitality—be it flowers, birds, landscapes, or scenes of everyday life—they evoked a sense of warmth at first glance. Yet, Xiaomo rarely smiled. The bridges he painted often stirred strange and complex emotions in people. They were not ordinary bridges but symbolic ones, seemingly leading to mysterious, distant places.\nVillagers said Xiaomo's obsession with painting bridges stemmed from an old incident.\nFifteen years ago, seven-year-old Xiaomo walked across the stone bridge outside the village with his father. Beyond the bridge lay a vast lake, shrouded in mist. From afar, the bridge seemed to vanish into the fog at its other end. His father held his hand and told him they were going to see a special kind of lotus—“Star Lotus,” which was said to bloom only on a full moon night. However, as they reached the middle of the bridge, Xiaomo slipped and fell into the lake.\nIn that moment, the icy water engulfed him, filling him with panic. But through the blur, he saw his father diving in after him. Strangely, Xiaomo felt as though he wasn’t sinking. Instead, an unseen force seemed to pull him toward the other side of the bridge. The water became clearer, and he could even see the bridge’s reflection on the lakebed. On the other side of the bridge, there was an unfamiliar place—a grassland dotted with starlight and distant mountains bathed in silver glow.\nBut his father did not appear there.\nWhen Xiaomo regained consciousness, he was lying on the lakeshore, soaked to the skin. His father, however, never returned. When the villagers found him, all he said was, “Dad went to the other side of the bridge.”\nNo one believed him. They simply said his father had drowned while trying to save him and would never come back.\nSince then, Xiaomo had never set foot on that bridge again. He grew quiet, shutting himself off from everyone. Until one day, he discovered painting. The moment he picked up a brush, a familiar feeling surged through him. He began painting bridges relentlessly. Some disappeared into the mist, others connected to starry skies, and some were flanked by strange, blooming flowers.\nThe villagers were amazed by his talent but never questioned the secrets behind those bridges.\nOne rainy night during the plum rain season, someone knocked on the window of Xiaomo’s studio. At the door stood a stranger, dressed in a dark raincoat and holding a staff carved with intricate patterns. He introduced himself as a traveling bridge craftsman who had heard of Xiaomo’s lifelike paintings and had come to visit.\n“A bridge craftsman?” Xiaomo frowned. He had never heard of such a title\nThe traveler smiled. “The bridges you paint are clearly not from reality. Perhaps you don’t even know where they lead.”\nXiaomo froze. Even he couldn’t explain why those bridges always appeared in his mind.\n“Come with me,” the traveler continued, “and maybe you’ll find your answer.”\nThat night, they headed to the small bridge from fifteen years ago. The misty rain remained, and the bridge’s stone slabs were slick, etched with the patterns of time. Standing in the middle of the bridge, the traveler murmured something under his breath, and suddenly, a soft light appeared at the other end.\nXiaomo’s heart raced. It was the same light he had glimpsed beneath the lake years ago. Step by step, he walked toward the end of the bridge, each step feeling like crossing an unfathomable rift in his memory.\nFinally, he reached the other side.\nThere was no starry grassland or silver-lit mountains, but a small house by a lakeshore. Xiaomo entered and found a sketchbook on the table. Each page depicted a bridge he had painted. On the last page was an unfinished drawing of a middle-aged man standing by a bridge, waving into the distance. His lips curved in a faint smile, his eyes filled with reluctance yet also a sense of relief.\nXiaomo finally understood. His father hadn’t left. He had embedded his love and protection into the bridges Xiaomo painted.\nThe next morning, as the traveler departed, Xiaomo felt for the first time that bridges were no longer his nightmare but a legacy his father had left him.\nFrom then on, Xiaomo’s paintings changed. He began painting the village’s bridges, the ones villagers walked across, and countless ordinary yet real bridges. He learned to reconcile with reality and let his heart return to the village and its life.\nWhenever someone asked why Xiaomo no longer painted those mysterious bridges, he would always smile and say, “Because I’ve already crossed to the other side.”\n######################\nOutput:\n"

The sunlight struggled to pierce through the moisture, creating a warm yet slightly dreamy atmosphere. A winding stream flowed through the village, and a bridge lay across it, like a link between two worlds.\\nLi Xiaomo was a renowned painter in the village. His works always carried an indescribable vitality\\u2014be it flowers, birds, landscapes, or scenes of everyday life\\u2014they evoked a sense of warmth at first glance. Yet, Xiaomo rarely smiled. The bridges he painted often stirred strange and complex emotions in people. They were not ordinary bridges but symbolic ones, seemingly leading to mysterious, distant places.\\nVillagers said Xiaomo's obsession with painting bridges stemmed from an old incident.\\nFifteen years ago, seven-year-old Xiaomo walked across the stone bridge outside the village with his father. Beyond the bridge lay a vast lake, shrouded in mist. From afar, the bridge seemed to vanish into the fog at its other end. His father held his hand and told him they were going to see a special kind of lotus\\u2014\\u201cStar Lotus,\\u201d which was said to bloom only on a full moon night. However, as they reached the middle of the bridge, Xiaomo slipped and fell into the lake.\\nIn that moment, the icy water engulfed him, filling him with panic. But through the blur, he saw his father diving in after him. Strangely, Xiaomo felt as though he wasn\\u2019t sinking. Instead, an unseen force seemed to pull him toward the other side of the bridge. The water became clearer, and he could even see the bridge\\u2019s reflection on the lakebed. On the other side of the bridge, there was an unfamiliar place\\u2014a grassland dotted with starlight and distant mountains bathed in silver glow.\\nBut his father did not appear there.\\nWhen Xiaomo regained consciousness, he was lying on the lakeshore, soaked to the skin. His father, however, never returned. When the villagers found him, all he said was, \\u201cDad went to the other side of the bridge.\\u201d\\nNo one believed him. They simply said his father had drowned while trying to save him and would never come back.\\nSince then, Xiaomo had never set foot on that bridge again. He grew quiet, shutting himself off from everyone. Until one day, he discovered painting. The moment he picked up a brush, a familiar feeling surged through him. He began painting bridges relentlessly. Some disappeared into the mist, others connected to starry skies, and some were flanked by strange, blooming flowers.\\nThe villagers were amazed by his talent but never questioned the secrets behind those bridges.\\nOne rainy night during the plum rain season, someone knocked on the window of Xiaomo\\u2019s studio. At the door stood a stranger, dressed in a dark raincoat and holding a staff carved with intricate patterns. He introduced himself as a traveling bridge craftsman who had heard of Xiaomo\\u2019s lifelike paintings and had come to visit.\\n\\u201cA bridge craftsman?\\u201d Xiaomo frowned. He had never heard of such a title\\nThe traveler smiled. \\u201cThe bridges you paint are clearly not from reality. Perhaps you don\\u2019t even know where they lead.\\u201d\\nXiaomo froze. Even he couldn\\u2019t explain why those bridges always appeared in his mind.\\n\\u201cCome with me,\\u201d the traveler continued, \\u201cand maybe you\\u2019ll find your answer.\\u201d\\nThat night, they headed to the small bridge from fifteen years ago. The misty rain remained, and the bridge\\u2019s stone slabs were slick, etched with the patterns of time. Standing in the middle of the bridge, the traveler murmured something under his breath, and suddenly, a soft light appeared at the other end.\\nXiaomo\\u2019s heart raced. It was the same light he had glimpsed beneath the lake years ago. Step by step, he walked toward the end of the bridge, each step feeling like crossing an unfathomable rift in his memory.\\nFinally, he reached the other side.\\nThere was no starry grassland or silver-lit mountains, but a small house by a lakeshore. Xiaomo entered and found a sketchbook on the table. Each page depicted a bridge he had painted. On the last page was an unfinished drawing of a middle-aged man standing by a bridge, waving into the distance. His lips curved in a faint smile, his eyes filled with reluctance yet also a sense of relief.\\nXiaomo finally understood. His father hadn\\u2019t left. He had embedded his love and protection into the bridges Xiaomo painted.\\nThe next morning, as the traveler departed, Xiaomo felt for the first time that bridges were no longer his nightmare but a legacy his father had left him.\\nFrom then on, Xiaomo\\u2019s paintings changed. He began painting the village\\u2019s bridges, the ones villagers walked across, and countless ordinary yet real bridges. He learned to reconcile with reality and let his heart return to the village and its life.\\nWhenever someone asked why Xiaomo no longer painted those mysterious bridges, he would always smile and say, \\u201cBecause I\\u2019ve already crossed to the other side.\\u201d\\n######################\\nOutput:\\n\"}, {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo is a renowned painter in the village, known for his paintings with an indescribable vitality and his obsession with painting bridges.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"small town\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The small town is the setting where the story takes place, characterized by misty mornings and a winding stream with a bridge across it.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"winding stream\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The winding stream is a natural feature of the village, flowing through the village and under the bridge.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"bridge\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The bridge is a central element in the story, symbolizing a link between worlds and a place of significant emotional connection for Li Xiaomo.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"Star Lotus\\\"<|>\\\"category\\\"<|>\\\"Star Lotus is a special kind of lotus that is said to bloom only on a full moon night, mentioned as a goal of Li Xiaomo and his father's journey across the bridge.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"vast lake\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The vast lake is located beyond the bridge and is mentioned as a destination for Li Xiaomo and his father, shrouded in mist and mystery.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"stone bridge\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The stone bridge is the bridge that Li Xiaomo and his father crossed, where the incident occurred that led to Li Xiaomo's painting obsession.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"icy water\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The icy water is the water of the lake into which Li Xiaomo fell after slipping on the bridge, filled with panic and the sensation of being pulled toward the other side.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"grassland\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The grassland is the place Li Xiaomo is pulled to after falling into the lake, described as starlit and with distant mountains in a silver glow.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"traveling bridge craftsman\\\"<|>\\\"person\\\"<|>\\\"The traveling bridge craftsman is a mysterious character who visits Li Xiaomo's studio and suggests that Li Xiaomo's bridges lead to unknown places.\\\")##\\n(\\\"entity\\\"<|>\\\"small house\\\"<|>\\\"geo\\\"<|>\\\"The small house is the destination Li Xiaomo reaches at the end of the bridge, where he finds a sketchbook depicting his bridges and a drawing of his father.\\\")##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo\\\"<|>\\\"small town\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo is a resident of the small town, where he is a renowned painter and where the story unfolds.\\\"|>\\\"residence, life context\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo\\\"<|>\\\"bridge\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo's paintings are obsessed with bridges, which are central to his life and work, stemming from the incident with his father.\\\"|>\\\"obsession, emotional connection\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo\\\"<|>\\\"stone bridge\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo's painting of the stone bridge is inspired by the incident that occurred there, where he fell into the lake.\\\"|>\\\"inspiration, personal history\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo\\\"<|>\\\"traveling bridge craftsman\\\"<|>\\\"The traveling bridge craftsman provides Li Xiaomo with an explanation for his painting obsession, leading him to cross the bridge again.\\\"|>\\\"explanation, revelation\\\"<|>8)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo\\\"<|>\\\"small house\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo finds a connection to his paintings and his father in the small house at the end of the bridge, discovering his father's legacy.\\\"|>\\\"discovery, legacy\\\"<|>9)##\\n(\\\"relationship\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo\\\"<|>\\\"small town\\\"<|>\\\"Li Xiaomo's paintings reflect the life and atmosphere of the small town, where he has lived and worked.\\\"|>\\\"representation, cultural context\\\"<|>7)##\\n(\\\"content_keywords\\\"<|>\\\"painting, bridge, legacy, father, mystery, small town, emotional journey\\\")<|COMPLETE|>\"}]\nMANY entities were missed in the last extraction.
